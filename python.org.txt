Our user base is enthusiastic, dedicated to encouraging use of the language, and committed to being diverse and friendly. Success Stories Arts Business Education Engineering Government Scientific Software Development Maintaining our ever-evolving Python codebase poses an intricate challenge: how do we make updates to reflect the changing rules and regulations of 200+ global markets without compromising access to the systems that our engineers and traders use on a daily basis? While an inner layer of shared business logic enables coherency in our codebase performance, it also means small regulatory changes can impact many systems.

In this article, Python Engineer John Lekberg details how we use Python type annotations to minimize the time and risk involved in manual verification.

Python allows mandatory and optional arguments, keyword arguments, and even arbitrary argument lists. More about defining functions in PythonÂ 3 # Python 3: List comprehensions >>> fruits = ['Banana', 'Apple', 'Lime']
>>> loud_fruits = [fruit.upper() for fruit in fruits]
>>> print(loud_fruits) ['BANANA', 'APPLE', 'LIME'] # List and the enumerate function >>> list(enumerate(fruits)) [(0, 'Banana'), (1, 'Apple'), (2, 'Lime')] Compound Data Types Lists (known as arrays in other languages) are one of the compound data types that Python understands. Lists can be indexed, sliced and manipulated with other built-in functions. More about lists in PythonÂ 3 # Python 3: Simple arithmetic >>> 1 / 2 0.5 >>> 2 ** 3 8 >>> 17 / 3 # classic division returns a float 5.666666666666667 >>> 17 // 3 # floor division 5 Intuitive Interpretation Calculations are simple with Python, and expression syntax is straightforward: the operators + , - , * and / work as expected; parentheses () can be used for grouping. More about simple math functions in PythonÂ 3 . # For loop on a list >>> numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
>>> product = 1
>>> for number in numbers:
...    product = product * number

>>> print('The product is:', product) The product is: 384 All the Flow Youâ€™d Expect Python knows the usual control flow statements that other languages speak â€” if , for , while and range â€” with some of its own twists, of course. More control flow tools in PythonÂ 3 # Simple output (with Unicode) >>> print("Hello, I'm Python!") Hello, I'm Python! # Input, assignment >>> name = input('What is your name?\n') What is your name?

Current approaches just create random locations inside a box, placing users in waterways or on top of buildings. This inability to make accurate, synthetic location data stifles a lot of innovative projects that require diverse and complex datasets to fuel their work.
